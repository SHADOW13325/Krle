## It is a simple intro project for javascript where I designed a time-table application. 
In this application you can ***Type of Activity*** and ***Activity Name*** in the table along with their ***starting and ending time***.
It will calculate the total time as per ***Type of Activity*** as well with some basic validations (like starting time < ending time).
